# System Capacity Calculator

A calculator for estimating system infrastructure requirements based on user load and usage patterns.

## üìã Features

### Input Parameters
- **Daily Active Users (DAU)** - Number of unique users active per day
- **Monthly Active Users (MAU)** - Number of unique users active per month
- **Session Patterns** - Average sessions per user and requests per session
- **Data Requirements** - Storage needs per user and response sizes
- **Performance Settings** - Cache hit rates and peak traffic multipliers

### Capacity Estimates
- **üî• Throughput** - Peak RPS, database QPS, and cache-optimized backend load
- **üíæ Storage** - Total storage with replication and backup considerations
- **‚ö° Cache** - Memory requirements for optimal performance
- **üåê Network Bandwidth** - Peak and average bandwidth with cache optimization
- **üìä System Summary** - Engagement metrics and architectural recommendations

## üéØ Use Cases

- **Startup Planning** - Estimate infrastructure costs before launch
- **Scaling Decisions** - Plan capacity upgrades based on growth projections
- **Architecture Reviews** - Validate system design assumptions
- **Cost Estimation** - Calculate cloud infrastructure requirements
- **Performance Planning** - Size caches, databases, and CDNs appropriately


## Calculation Methods

**Throughput Calculations:**
- Peak RPS = (DAU √ó Sessions √ó Requests √ó Peak Multiplier) / (24 √ó 3600)
- Database QPS = Peak RPS √ó 2.5 (accounts for complex queries)
- Effective RPS = Peak RPS √ó (1 - Cache Hit Rate)

**Storage Calculations:**
- Base Storage = MAU √ó Data per User
- With Replication = Base √ó 3 (master + 2 replicas)
- With Backups = Replicated √ó 1.5 (backup overhead)

**Cache Calculations:**
- Cache Size = DAU √ó Data per User √ó 0.3 (30% of active data)
- Includes 20% overhead for metadata and fragmentation

**Bandwidth Calculations:**
- Daily Transfer = Requests √ó Response Size
- Peak Bandwidth accounts for 70% network efficiency
- Cache reduces bandwidth by hit rate percentage

### Key Assumptions
- 20% safety margin for unexpected load spikes
- 15% of DAU are concurrent users during peak hours
- Database queries are 2.5x API requests (complex operations)
- Network efficiency of 70% due to protocol overhead
- Cache stores 30% of active user data for optimal hit rates

## üìä Example Calculations

### Small Application
- **Input**: 10K DAU, 50K MAU, 3 sessions/day, 20 requests/session
- **Output**: ~7 RPS peak, 1.5 GB storage, 10 Mbps bandwidth

### Medium Application
- **Input**: 100K DAU, 500K MAU, 5 sessions/day, 30 requests/session
- **Output**: ~521 RPS peak, 18 GB storage, 156 Mbps bandwidth

### Large Application
- **Input**: 1M DAU, 5M MAU, 4 sessions/day, 25 requests/session
- **Output**: ~3,472 RPS peak, 180 GB storage, 1.04 Gbps bandwidth
